## SoftwareDefinedNetworking
This repository is an aggregation of the concepts that form the Nuts and Bolts of Microsoft SDN (Software Defined Networking)

### Important Note
All the concepts explained in this repo have been based on references from the official MS docs and a few external articles. The references are captured in the next section and sometimes within each of the pages too. That said, credits for all the awesomeness of the content are due to the authors of the respective articles.
